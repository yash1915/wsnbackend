# üåê Wireless Sensor Network Based Smart Industrial Safety & Hazard Detection System

### üìÖ Duration
August 2025 ‚Äì October 2025

This is the backend repository for my final year project.

## üß≠ Project Overview
This project is using an ESP32 to collect real-time data from gas, temperature, motion, and flame sensors. 
A full-stack web dashboard, built with Node.js and MongoDB, provides live monitoring, historical data graphs, and a log of all triggered events. 
The system ensures immediate hazard response through an automated dual-alert system, featuring on-site buzzer alarms and instant email notifications.
**Check out the live frontend dashboard here:** [[Frontend Repo](https://github.com/yash1915/wsnfrontend) or [Demo](https://wsnfrontend.vercel.app/)]

## The Problem üéØ

Industrial workplaces often face hidden hazards such as:
- Gas leaks  
- Overheating machinery  
- Unauthorized access
  
Traditional periodic safety checks **cannot detect these instantly**, putting workers and machinery at risk.


## Our Solution ‚ú®

This system acts as a **digital nervous system** for a facility. It uses a network of sensors to constantly monitor the environment and provides three key features:
- **Live Monitoring:** Track all sensor readings in real-time  
- **Historical Data:** Analyze past events to identify patterns and risks  
- **Instant Alerts:** Receive immediate **email notifications** and **local buzzer alerts** when a hazard is detected
-

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Sensor Nodes:**  
   An ESP32 microcontroller collects data from sensors:  
   - Gas (MQ-2)  
   - Temperature & Humidity (DHT22)  
   - Motion (PIR)  
   - Flame  

2. **Data Transmission:**  
   Data is sent over Wi-Fi from ESP32 to the Node.js backend.

3. **Backend Processing:**  
   - Node.js/Express server stores data in **MongoDB**  
   - Uses **WebSockets** to push real-time updates to the dashboard  
   - Sends **email alerts** on threshold breaches  

4. **Dashboard:**  
   Frontend visualizes live readings, historical trends, and alert logs.
